    <h2>Here are some things I did in the past</h2>
    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I started my design journey as an architect and then discovered I wanted to build not a physical structure but digital products. I am interested in human relations with digital products and constantly seek better ways to enhance that relationship. With the solid design-oriented education I took, I am now improving my skills in the digital field. I can quickly adapt to new conditions.</p>
